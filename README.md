# My Personal Project

My project will be for any type of **business** that sells any asset. 
It will take in each inputted item by the user, it's price, and how expensive it is to 
get one of it in stock. The user can then input the number of sales for that item
and check how much profit they made. This will work with *any* type of business
(clothing, restaurant, etc.). There will also be a feature in which the app will make
a list of all items, ranking them by total profit. This will help the user decide what
to do with their business. It is of interest to me because in the future, I would like to
start a business, and I believe this app would be very helpful in managing it.
